People with visual disabilities (8.5% of the global population) are typically included late (if at all) in the design of Internet services.  Some parts of the Web (e.g. those catering to the provision of public services) are regulated and consequently function well with technologies such as screen readers, but other services will include such support as an after-thought, if at all.  When such services become very important, this has the effect of increasing the exclusion of some of society’s most vulnerable people.",

          "narrative": "<p>There are a number of consequences of current Internet growth: The companies who are building the infrastructure, especially in poorer countries, are not realising as much money from the Internet as a smaller number of companies have.  These companies reside especially in Silicon Valley, and have disrupted much of the network operators’ business.  Where once network operators charged tariffs for messaging and international calls, much of this now runs “over the top”, meaning that Internet software mediates these services as IP-traffic, rather than as traditional network operator services.  This has provided a disincentive for these companies to invest in network equipment.</p><p>Mozilla believes that open and equal access, promoted by net neutrality, is a prerequisite for a healthy Internet. However, the economic consequences of such policy must be recognized. Net neutrality promotes the shifting of communication from heavily regulated traditional network operator services to IP-traffic on the largely unregulated software layer. Yet network operators build and maintain the physical infrastructure upon which the software layer runs.  In 2014, we have a largely unregulated software layer (of apps and content) which is fueling the world’s most valuable companies, running on top of a heavily regulated infrastructure layer (the physical network).</p>",
