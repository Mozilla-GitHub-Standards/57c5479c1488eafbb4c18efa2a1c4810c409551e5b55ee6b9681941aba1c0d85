    <p>This has, however, been a feature of 
    consumption of the Internet from very early in its existence. Content
    is consumed for free and “monetised” through advertising: most models
    aimed at monetising (i.e. charging directly for) content, have floundered
    because of the large volume of potential substitutes and very low cost of
    switching.  This has in  turn led to an experience of online publishers
    trying to garner as many “clicks” and delivering advertisers as many
    relevant “impressions” (views of an advert) as possible, influencing
    editorial policy and user experience."
