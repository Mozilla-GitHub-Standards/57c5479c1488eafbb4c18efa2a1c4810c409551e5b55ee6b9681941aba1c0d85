However, the economic consequences of such policy must be recognized. Net neutrality promotes the shifting of communication from heavily regulated traditional network operator services to IP-traffic on the largely unregulated software layer. Yet network operators build and maintain the physical infrastructure upon which the software layer runs.  In 2014, we have a largely unregulated software layer (of apps and content) which is fueling the world’s most valuable companies, running on top of a heavily regulated infrastructure layer (the physical network).</p>",
